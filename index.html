        JavaScript Loading Strategies <br> (async and defer)
    </h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            async allows js files to download as html is parsing
            and will pause html loading only until excecute js is complete
        </p>
        <p>
            defer allows js files to download as html is parsing
            and will execute js after html has finished parsing (loading)
        </p>
        <p>
            no async and defer: html parsing (loading) is paused until js
            is downloaded and excecuted (deployed)
        </p>
    </div>

    <h1>JavaScript Outputs</h1>
        <p>

            this will pop up an alert in browser which you need to click ok to continue
        </p>
        <p>
            prompt("example question?", "placeholder answer");
            this will pop up an alert in browser which you need to type in an answer and click ok
        </p>
        <p>
            confirm("are you sure you want to continue?");
